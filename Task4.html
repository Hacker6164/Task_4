            <b>CHANDRAYAAN</b>
        </h1>
        <P>The Chandrayaan programme (Sanskrit: चन्द्रयान, romanized: Candrayāna, lit.'Moon craft',
            pronunciation) also known as the Indian Lunar Exploration Programme is an ongoing series of outer
            space missions by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO). The programme incorporates lunar orbiter,
            impactor, soft lander and rover spacecraft.

            There are have been three missions so far with a total of two orbiters, landers and rovers each. While the
            two orbiters were successful, the first lander and rover which were part of the Chandrayaan-2 mission,
            crashed on the surface. The current composite is currently on its way to the Moon under the Chandrayaan-3
            mission</P>
        <H2><B>Programme-Structure</B></H2>
        <p>The Chandrayaan (Indian Lunar Exploration Programme) programme is a multiple mission programme. As of
            September 2019, one orbiter with an impactor probe has been sent to the Moon, using ISRO's workhorse PSLV
            rocket. The second spacecraft consisting of orbiter, soft lander and rover was launched on 22 July 2019, by
            using a LVM-3 rocket. In a podcast from AT, VSSC director S. Somanath stated that there will be a
            Chandrayaan-3 and more follow up missions in Chandrayaan Program.[5] The Chandrayaan-3 mission was launched
            in 14 July 2023 using LVM-3 and it is expected to reach Moon's surface in August</p>
        <h2><b>Phase-1: impactor</b></h2>
        <p>Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee announced the Chandrayaan project on course in his Independence Day
            speech on 15 August 2003. The mission was a major boost to India's space program. The idea of an Indian
            scientific mission to the Moon was first mooted in 1999 during a meeting of the Indian Academy of Sciences.
            The Astronautical Society of India carried forward the idea in 2000. Soon after, the Indian Space Research
            Organisation (ISRO) set up the National Lunar Mission Task Force which concluded that ISRO has the technical
            expertise to carry out an Indian mission to the Moon. In April 2003 over 100 eminent Indian scientists in
            the fields of planetary and space sciences, Earth sciences, physics, chemistry, astronomy, astrophysics and
            engineering and communication sciences discussed and approved the Task Force recommendation to launch an
            Indian probe to the Moon. Six months later, in November, the Indian government gave the nod for the mission.
            The first phase includes the launch of the first lunar orbiters.

            Chandrayaan-1, launched on 22 October 2008 aboard a PSLV-XL rocket, was a big success for ISRO as the Moon
            Impact Probe, a payload on board the Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft, discovered water on the Moon. Apart from
            discovering water the Chandrayaan-1 mission performed several other tasks such as mapping and atmospheric
            profiling of the Moon.
        </p>
        <h2><b>Phase II: Soft landers and rovers</b></h2>
        <p>On 18 September 2008, the First Manmohan Singh Cabinet approved the mission.[7][8] Although ISRO finalised
            the payload for Chandrayaan-2 per schedule,[9] the mission was postponed in January 2013[10] and rescheduled
            to 2016 because Russia was unable to develop the lander on time.[11][12] Roscosmos later withdrew in wake of
            the failure of the Fobos-Grunt mission to Mars, since the technical aspects connected with the Fobos-Grunt
            mission were also used in the lunar projects, which needed to be reviewed.[11] When Russia cited its
            inability to provide the lander even by 2015, India decided to develop the lunar mission
            independently[10][13] and unused orbiter hardware was repurposed to be used for Mars Orbiter Mission.[14]

            Chandrayaan-2 was launched on 22 July 2019[15] aboard a LVM3 rocket. The spacecraft was successfully put
            into lunar orbit on August 20, 2019[16] but the lander was lost while attempting to land on 6 September
            2019.[17] The orbiter is operational, collecting scientific data,[18] and is expected to function for 7.5
            years.[19]

            Chandrayaan-3
            In November 2019, ISRO officials stated that a new lunar lander mission was being studied for launch in
            November 2020. This new proposal is called Chandrayaan-3 and it would be a re-attempt to demonstrate the
            landing capabilities needed for the Lunar Polar Exploration Mission proposed in partnership with Japan for
            2025.[20] This spacecraft configuration would not include launching an orbiter and would have a lander,
            rover, and a propulsion module[21] with mission costing ₹ 250 crore with additional launch costs of ₹ 365
            crore for LVM3.[22][23] This third mission would land in the same area as the second one.[24] Chandrayaan-3
            was launched on 14 July 2023 at 9:05:17 UTC.[6] The primary goals of the Chandrayaan-3 mission encompass
            three key aspects. Firstly, it aims to showcase a successful and controlled touchdown on the lunar surface.
            Secondly, it intends to demonstrate the mobility of a rover on the Moon's terrain. Lastly, it seeks to carry
            out scientific experiments directly on the lunar surface.[25]</p>
        <h2><b>Phase III: On site sampling</b></h2>
        <p>The next mission will be the Lunar Polar Exploration Mission or Chandrayaan-4, suggested to be launched in
            2025.[26][27][28] India is collaborating with Japan in this mission but the mission is not yet defined. It
            will be a lander-rover mission near lunar pole to perform on site sampling and analysis of collected lunar
            material and demonstrate lunar night survival technologies The mission has been suggested for time frame of
            2025-30. It will include a lander based rotary-percussive drilling in lunar soil up to a depth of 1~1.5
            meters and analysis of cut using instruments. A volcanically and tectonically active area on near side of
            the Moon will be selected for experiment</p>
        <h2><b>Information from Isro</b></h2>
        <p>Lander payloads: Chandra’s Surface Thermophysical Experiment (ChaSTE) to measure the thermal conductivity and
            temperature; Instrument for Lunar Seismic Activity (ILSA) for measuring the seismicity around the landing
            site; Langmuir Probe (LP) to estimate the plasma density and its variations. A passive Laser Retroreflector
            Array from NASA is accommodated for lunar laser ranging studies.

            Rover payloads: Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) and Laser Induced Breakdown Spectroscope (LIBS) for
            deriving the elemental composition in the vicinity of landing site.

            Gallery
            Appraisal
            Chandrayaan-3 consists of an indigenous Lander module (LM), Propulsion module (PM) and a Rover with an
            objective of developing and demonstrating new technologies required for Inter planetary missions. The Lander
            will have the capability to soft land at a specified lunar site and deploy the Rover which will carry out
            in-situ chemical analysis of the lunar surface during the course of its mobility. The Lander and the Rover
            have scientific payloads to carry out experiments on the lunar surface. The main function of PM is to carry
            the LM from launch vehicle injection till final lunar 100 km circular polar orbit and separate the LM from
            PM. Apart from this, the Propulsion Module also has one scientific payload as a value addition which will be
            operated post separation of Lander Module. The launcher identified for Chandrayaan-3 is GSLV-Mk3 which will
            place the integrated module in an Elliptic Parking Orbit (EPO) of size ~170 x 36500 km.</p>
